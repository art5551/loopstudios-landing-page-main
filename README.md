## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Struggled a bit getting the background image stable for both mobile and desktop. Tried to utilize the picture element to easiy toggle between two modes but it wont work as a background.
Was using flex to center/justify items on screen but is not viable for ths project. Instead, started setting body width to 100% and then giving child elements a max-width and setting margin auto will center the element. Basing the child element, in this case, to the width of the supplied image, 1440px.
